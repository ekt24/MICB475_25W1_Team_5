## Discuss Manuscript
* Original study limitations = our limitations?
  * Reference data collection limitations with respect to the original study on top of our own study’s limitations.
* Do we need to cite Avril’s code, and inclusion of feature importance analysis in methods
  * No need to cite
  * Can leave out feature importance analysis as it was not used in the end
* Should we include statistical analyses performed with biomarkers as part of te RF section in methods?
  * Yes
* How detailed and in depth should we provide as background context in our introduction?
  * Do not mention specific taxa as we looked at impact of overall microbiome composition but you can still mention specific pathways and implication for disease
* Figure S1 and Table S1
  * Use theme classic, make subtitles larger, get rid of title on top of box charts, add units and sample size to table S1

## To Do 
* Change title to better connect gut microbiome + biomarkers to OUD status prediction
* Increase plot text size, remove unnecessary titles
* Complete manuscript
* Organize GitHub repository
