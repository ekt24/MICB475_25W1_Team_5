# Meeting Minutes - Nov 20
## Agenda
* Progress on Aims 1 & 2
* Results of alpha and beta analysis? and Results of deseq?
* Which specific taxa to choose for Random Forest modelling

## Progress on Aims
* Aim 1 code is running a bit behind, no anticipated issues however - will be completed by tonight for use in Aim 3
  * Ensure you do NOT use rarefied phyloseq object for Aim 2, give Toma the unrarified object (only use the rarified object for your analysis
* Aim 2 code is ready to run, will be run following Aim 1, code looks clean, no concerns
  * Once we have deseq results, we can narrow down the taxa
* Aim 3 will be run on the weekend
  * If there are no signficant results, whats the back up?
    * We can run diversity test on clinical biomarkers and see if that alone works to produce good results in the predicitive model and compare this with the combined model

## To do
* Wilcoxon on biomarkers to narrow down biomarkers, then build random forest model for biomarkers; Run a for loop to test all biomarkers at once
* Bring results from all aims to the meeting next week
* Bring draft PPT to review
