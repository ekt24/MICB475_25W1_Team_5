# Agenda

## Goals
* Progress on Aims 1 & 2
* Results of alpha and beta analysis? and Results of deseq?
* Which specific taxa to choose for Random Forest modelling

# Meeting Minutes

# To do
* Wilcoxon on biomarkers to narrow down biomarkers, then build random forest model for biomarkers; Run a for loop to test all biomarkers at once
* We can figure out how to narrow down taxa after we get deseq results
