# Meeting Minutes - Oct 2
## Goal of Team Meetings
* Dedicated support time 
* Based on whatever type of support we need, anything we need to troubleshoot, direction on project, etc.
* We are responsible for future agendas, needed day before (on repo, don’t need to email it to prof) → good agenda = productive meeting 
  * Break into 2 parts: ideas & what we want to talk about
  * Stored on git repo (EVERYTHING GOES ON HERE)
  * Git repo can be published in paper & is good documentation proof for employment portfolio
  * Anyone should be able to navigate, can brush up with additional module 18
## Types of Projects
* Exploratory, don't know what variables you want to assess, choose couple variables, run alpha, find significant variables and continue with analysis
* Traditional, pick variable(s), compare different groups (intervention and control) - this is more popular, more computational heavy (at the start at least)
* It’s easier to find a novel question (especially for pre-existing datasets in the course) if you’re willing to do a more advanced analysis vs more basic. What do they mean by more advanced analysis?
  * Ie. Random force/forest analysis, functional analysis, network analysis
  * Can look at code from previous teams as reference 
  * There is still support for all ‘advanced’ analysis, we can get resources from the teaching team
* Aim: Medical microbiology focus. Can aim for more advance analysis (again, frees up options for novel research questions)
## Ideas
* New dataset ideas
  * Olfactory or gut microbiota of people who do and do not use opioids
  * Multiple myeloma, gut microbiota
    * Send research articles on the above ideas which mention 16S rRNA analysis
    * Send by sunday night (they will check monday), they will lets us know if viable by end of monday → discuss this with team → come with ideas of research questions (ideally finalized by end of next meeting)
* Existing ones we are interested in: Parkinson's, gastric cancer, alcoholism, depression (has many datasets) COVID (can find new COVID datasets too) 
   * If we want to do these, it will be harder to find a novel question especially since a few (like Parkinson’s) have been here for long and used for many projects
## TO DO Before next meeting:
* Compile list of articles with potential new data sets 
* Fill out when2meet for a quick 30 min meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday to finalize topic
* Brainstorm research questions
* Set up Git repo and create next meeting agenda
