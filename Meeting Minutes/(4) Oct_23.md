# Agenda
## Proposal Questions/Notes 
* How can we use AI to assist our proposal writing?
  * AI is okay for learning, not for doing your work entirely (don’t just paste your bullets and have it make a first draft), use it when you’re struggling with wording specific sentences (not your default)
* Gantt chart alterations
  * Considering making troubleshooting more informative → 1 for Aim 1 and 2, other for 3 &4
  * Include proposal writing 
  * Can get started on multiple aims at the same time, over a longer period
    * Group Aim 1 & 2 and 3 & 4 progress together
  * Separate presentation prep and delivery
* Need to explicitly indicate how our research is different from the original paper we are referencing
* Intro 
  * Define all key terms 
  * Cite previous research on opioid use and/or substance use disorders, the gut, and clinical biomarkers (do not repeat this in the aim section)
  * The work you cite should improve why the answer to your question is unclear (consider use of methodologies, what makes our cohort important, etc.)
* Hypothesis/Rationale Section
  * Why are we doing this
    * Assess risk factor before prescribing opioids
    * See if someone's microbiome after starting opioids is indicative of them showing patterns of addiction (for those who underwent a procedure and were prescribed them, like a check-up)
  * Include a paper that makes interaction between opioids and microbiomes actually interact (otherwise the study is irrelevant) 
    * Don’t go too far in depth on the mechanisms, just mention implications of how microbiome can affect different health outcomes
* Future directions
  * Pharmacomicrobiomics  → how drugs are metabolized and interact with the  body (consideration for draft manuscript)
* TAs will deduct marks for going off topic
* Do a spell check
* Be cautious about jumps in logic (ie. correlation is causation)
## Data Processing
* Classifier training
  * Start with the long classifier
  * Full length, find primer, excise, and train that portion of the data
    * Code for training is in m6 mpt taxonomic analysis
  * Training a classifier can take DAYS (bare min is an evening), use a screen
  * Our primer is common, google “341F/806R”?
* Do we want to bootstrap because our dataset is not big?
  * No….
* Complete Wilcox for biomarkers, to see what is more important → run all and pick top 10 for the random forest

## To Do
* continue working on the proposal, email any questions to Avril
