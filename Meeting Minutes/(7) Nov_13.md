# Meeting Minutes - Nov 13
## Agenda
* questions regarding comments made on proposal
* review background section of oral presenation 
## Proposal Revision Questions

* How in-depth do we need to explain the OUD criteria?
  * Only include how the scoring is done, what are the minimal requirements and is there any sepcific of the disorder above that (this can be done within the same sentence - do not need a lot of detail)
* Citing according to ASM guidelines
  * There was a misunderstanding, the mark will be reinstated according to the citation source provided in the assignment
* How can we differentiate between the first portion of our hypothesis and the original study?
  * It is difficult to differentiate, focus on reframing it as a precursor to the modeling step
* Aims
  * No big changes needed for 1 & 2, add 1-3 sentences on prior research/reasoning to support the chosen approach
  * For 3, clarify the TAs concerns directly as possible, this explanation may need to be longer, 3-5 sentences.

## Oral Presentation 

* The slide deck looks good so far!
* Once aims are done and we have outcomes, can add those and bring to next meeting to discuss how those can be included for the presentation

## To Do

* Revise proposal and resubmit by Nov 17
* Complete aim 1 & 2 for the next meeting
