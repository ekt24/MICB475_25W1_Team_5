# Agenda
## Goals
* confirm dataset
* narrow down (and potentially finalize) a research question(s)
  * decide if proceeding with a more basic/advance analysis
  * if final, draft workflow & analysis timeline
## Meeting Minutes
### Research Question/Dataset Discussion
* Dataset chosen: Gut & Opioid Use Dataset
  * Note: Opioid Use is only indicated as 'Yes' in this dataset for patients who meet the  Opioid Use Disorder critera according to DSM-4.
* Tentative analysis routes
  * carry out basic diversity analysis to start using the Exploratory Data Analysis route to get best ~10 variables (?) - dataset might not be big enough but can still get decent results
  * differential abdunace analysis (additional module 19)
  * compile a predictive analysis on gut dataset (essentially compying what was done for the skin microbiome paper, but for this dataset), using random forest analysis
  * use pi-crust to look at metabolic pathways to answer a novel question(?)
* Tentative Research Question
  * Does combining gut microbiome data with clinical biomarkers improve the prediction accuracy of Opioid Use Disorder compared to using either alone?
### Research Proposal Prep
* Will be discussed next week, bring questions
* We only need to do quality control processing  in qiime for the proposal, no diversity analysis yet
## To Do 
* read through the proposal, and bring a list of questions to the next meeting
* start processing stuff in qiime (after Evelyn or Avril confirm that the dataset is available on the server)
* create next meeting agenda by Wednesday night
