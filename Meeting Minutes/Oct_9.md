# Agenda
## Goals
* confirm dataset
* narrow down (and potentially finalize) a research question(s)
  * decide if proceeding with a more basic/advance analysis
  * if final, draft workflow & analysis timeline
## Research Question Discussion
* Dataset chosen: Gut & Opioid Use Dataset
* struggling with finding a novel question
  * skin microbiome dataset focuses on microbime differences across regions and uses both basic and advance analysis (random forest), unable to understand what metadata can be further analyzed since the only variables mentioned are skin regions - which have been thoroughly analyszed 
  * gut and opioid use dataset focuses on T2D and insulin resistance, lots of variables we could use, but likely not novel... sort of lost on what could be done with this dataset
  * do we want to stick with a previous dataset instead?
## Additional Questions/Ideas for Prof & Team Members
* regarding the two new datasets: is it feasible to do a skin-gut axis analysis? to see if the indicators for opioid use from analyzing the skin micriobiome is aligned with that of the gut microbiota
# Meeting Notes
* can do predicitve analysis on gut dataset (complementing what was done from the skin microbiome)
* Avril suggests using random forest analysis
* clarification on opiod-use patients
* patients with opioid use were identified using DSM-4
* looking at metabolic pathways using pi-crust (module 19)
* focus on biomarkers vs microbiome, or together - which one is the better predictor
* use EDA to get best of 10-15 variables (can't do too few or too many), generla diversity metrics - which microbiome variables are 
* differential abduance - next module
* only need to process stuff in qiime for the proposal
## TO DO 
* next week is all about the proposal - bring questions!!
* read through proposals, read what is required...
