# Agenda
## Goals
* confirm dataset
* narrow down (and potentially finalize) a research question(s)
  * decide if proceeding with a more basic/advance analysis
  * if final, draft workflow & analysis timeline
## Meeting Minutes
### Research Question/Dataset Discussion
* Dataset chosen: Gut & Opioid Use Dataset
 * Note: Opioid Use is only indicated as 'Yes' in this dataset for patients who meet the  Opioid Use Disorder critera according to DSM-4.
* tentative analysis routes
  * comple a predictive analysis on gut dataset (essentially compying what was done for the skin microbiome paper, but for this dataset), using random forest analysis
 
  * 

# Meeting Notes
* can do predicitve analysis on gut dataset (complementing what was done from the skin microbiome)
* Avril suggests using random forest analysis
* clarification on opiod-use patients
* patients with opioid use were identified using DSM-4
* looking at metabolic pathways using pi-crust (module 19)
* focus on biomarkers vs microbiome, or together - which one is the better predictor
* use EDA to get best of 10-15 variables (can't do too few or too many), generla diversity metrics - which microbiome variables are 
* differential abduance - next module
* only need to process stuff in qiime for the proposal
## TO DO 
* next week is all about the proposal - bring questions!!
* read through proposals, read what is required...
