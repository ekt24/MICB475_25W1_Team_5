# Meeting Minutes - Oct 16
## Agenda 
* go through proposal questions
* updates on our progress with the qimme pipeline
## Proposal Questions
* Do we need to have completed the Gantt chart for the proposal deadline?
   * Yes, it must be in the proposal
   * Doesn't need to be too extensive, just follow the criteria
   * Ensure the timeline is reasonable and considers troubleshooting and how the data workflow is staggered
* What's the ending point for the qiime pipeline (for the proposal and in general)? (ie. do we only do quality control, or also do diversity metrics on qiime?)
   * In general - after we have ASVs, we can do everything else in R for the entire project (diversity metrics, etc.)
   * For the Proposal - do rarefaction curve in qiime because it is required, indicate we are truncated here, and rarefy to this step
* How do we provide our experimental questions in an aim form?
   * Aims: (1) diversity metrics, (2) differential abundance-specific microbial abundance so which specific taxa, (3) random forest
   * Format them in sentences using vocabulary such as ‘to determine…’, it should be objective
   * Multiple ways to format, but ensure the structure is consistent across the proposal
   * No more than a page for each aim, couple paragraphs, reference sample proposals
* What are the areas of improvement for a proposal in general? (Common Mistakes)
   * Example 1 is more typical length 
   * Using too much research is a common mistake, our introduction should be focused
      * Be conscious about not info dumping
      * All info should be relevant to what we are doing, how and why
      * Good overview of who has used the dataset and other related/relevant RQs
         * If there isn’t much explicitly, state that
   * Make it clear to your TA that you know why your including what your including and why you chose not to include something
      * Otherwise they can only assume you didn't consider it
   * Be detailed in the proposed approach
      * Don’t just say diversity → include what type, what function you’ll use, how you’ll show the result, what stats you're using?
   * Cite every tool you use
   * Goal is to be more and more specific throughout 
   * Your timeline should be considerate of everyone, and its okay to have overlapping portion (it likely should)
      * Think about what your running critically and how they integrate

## Proposal Outline
* RQ: Does combining gut microbiome data with clinical biomarkers improve the prediction accuracy of Opioid Use Disorder compared to only using clinical biomarkers?
* Aim 1: To determine if there is significant difference in alpha & beta diversity between non-opioid users and patients with OUD 
* Aim 2: To determine if there are significant differences in the relative abundance of taxa between non-opioid users and patients with OUD 
* Aim 3: To predict opioid use via random forest models using both clinical biomarker data and microbiome data or the former alone. 

## Qiime Progress
* Demux is done, everything done up until the trim portion
   * We can trim at 240 for forward reads and 200 for reverse reads
* Allowed to use both forward and reverse reads
   * It’s okay if reverse reads have worse quality
   * We can treat them independently, so we can use a lower threshold Phred score for the reverse reads
* Notes for accessing progress
   * Use group server
   * Always use a screen when running something

## To Do
* Have decent chunk of the proposal done for the next week (share google doc link with Avril)
