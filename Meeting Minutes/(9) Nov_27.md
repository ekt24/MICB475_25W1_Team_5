# Meeting Minutes - Nov 27
## Agenda
* go over results for all the aims
* feedback on the presenation
* any manuscript questions

## Discuss Results
* Alpha and Beta Diversity showed no significance
* Deseq showed significant taxa differences between the 2 groups
* RF Results and future steps
  * Unfortunately not predictive, in line with the diversity analysis though
  * Only disease produced significant taxa, so emphasize this finding in the presentation

## Presentation

* Deck Link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EUpkIxFBG3Ra8l9hAJCuPSXFAiuoa7tZLAouJBIO4aM/edit?usp=sharing

  * Remove n/a sample
  * Change format to box plot

## Manuscript Planning
* Figure 1: panel A will be shannon box-plot, panel B will be PCoA
* Figure 2: panel A is the deseq2 volcano, panel B is the barplot
* Figure 3: 6 panels of what the significant biomarkers are
* Figure 4: 3 panels of the RF models
* Supplementary figure of 20 taxa (similar to panels for biomarkers) (4x5 grid) 

## To Do
