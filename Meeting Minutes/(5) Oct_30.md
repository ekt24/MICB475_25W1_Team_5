# Meeting Minutes - Oct 30
## Agenda
* Go through work done on proposal 
* Go over any problems encountered during QIIME pipeline
* Formatting Qs
## Proposal Questions
* Formatting 
  * Keep a 1.5 space
  * Keep it briefer rather than longer (if referencing for experimental aim, proposal 1 >> 2 )
* Intro Section
  * Focus on bio topics more than tools, but don’t need to bring up examples of these but brief explanation (ie. cytokines are immune signalling molecules)
  * Focus on the biomarkers we will actually use, for other things just do categories (in an appendix)
* Aim 3
  * Explain the pros and cons of each dataset alone and why the prediction model may work better

## Troubleshooting Qiime

* Read quality is severely being affected with the paired-reads, what are some options to troubleshoot
  * Review, debug, and rerun - this did not workout
  * Remove reverse reads - this option produced sufficient results for the proposal

## To Do
* Complete the proposal by Nov 2
* Email Avril about any further concerns with qiime or proposal writing
